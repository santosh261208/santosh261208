# Hey, I'm Santosh 👋

I'm a 17-year-old from Switzerland currently doing an IT apprenticeship in application development. Besides my apprenticeship, I'm teaching myself Flutter and Dart because I genuinely love programming and want to build cool stuff.

I'm documenting my entire learning journey here on GitHub – check out my [flutter-learning](https://github.com/santosh261208/flutter-learning) repo if you want to follow along.

Outside of coding, I train karate, listen to way too much music, watch anime, and dream about traveling to Japan one day. I'm also into videography and want to start making vlogs eventually.
